        <h2>The fork research</h2>
        <p>for a better UX we had to know the different type of users, specially because the fork not only deals with normal users, but also with restaurant owners. for this reason we had to book a table in real time through the app to get the experience of a normal user. we also contacted some of the restaurants to have a better knowledge of how they work with the app.</p>
